God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth
There is dignity in all labor
Imagination is more important than knowledge
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment
The best place to find a helping hand is at the end of your own arm
If your strength is small, don't carry heavy burdens. If your words are worthless, don't give advice
If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow
If you must play, decide upon three things at the start: the rules of the game, the stakes, and the quitting time
Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere
A change is as good as a rest
A known mistake is better than an unknown truth
Arrogance is a weed that grows mostly on a dunghill
A cutting word is worse than a bowstring, a cut may heal, but the cut of the tongue does not
A fool looks for dung where the cow never browsed
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for something
Adversity is the foundation of virtue
An excess of courtesy is discourtesy
Opinions founded on prejudice are always sustained with the greatest violence
In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of
The cautious seldom err
